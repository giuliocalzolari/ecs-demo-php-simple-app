# Amazon ECS PHP Simple Demo App
Directions on how to launch this sample app on Amazon ECS can be found in the documentation: [Docker basics](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html).


# Summary
A basic RESTful API framework written in PHP. Allows you to create a web service where data can be accessed in a simple URL format such as **http://example.com/api/[resource]/[id]**.

# Installation
Simply deploy the files on your web server. Then, create your controllers as in the **classes/controllers/** directory. The sample `NewsController` uses a flat-file approach to storing data, but this can be easily extended to use a database or other data source.
